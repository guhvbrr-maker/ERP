# Feature Summary - Multi-Tenant ERP with Super Admin Panel

## 🎯 Objective

Transform the ERP system into a **SaaS platform** that can be sold to multiple clients, with:
- Blocked public registration for security
- First user automatically becomes admin
- Central control panel for system owner
- Complete data isolation between organizations

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. 🔒 Public Signup Blocked

**Location**: `/signup` route

**What Changed**:
- Public registration completely disabled
- Page automatically redirects to login
- Shows informative message: "Novos usuários devem ser cadastrados internamente"
- Only admins can create new users inside the system

**Security Benefit**: Prevents unauthorized access and spam registrations

### 2. 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

**New Tables**:

#### `organizations`

- subscription_status: trial | active | suspended | cancelled
- max_users: User limit
- max_products: Product limit

```

#### `organization_users`
Links users to organizations:
```
- organization_id: Which organization
- user_id: Which user
- is_owner: Is the organization admin?
```

**Modified Tables**:
Added `organization_id` to isolate data:
- people (customers, suppliers, employees)
- positions
- categories
- products
- sales
- inventory_items

**Automatic Features**:
- ✅ Data automatically filtered by organization

## 🔄 How It Works

### Flow for New Client:

```
1. Super Admin creates organization
   └─> Organization active with trial status
   
2. Super Admin or Org Admin creates first user
   └─> Auto-assigned as organization admin
   └─> Receives admin role automatically
   
3. Organization Admin adds employees
   └─> Employees created via Pessoas > Funcionários
   └─> Each gets appropriate roles
   
4. All work within isolated environment
   └─> Can't see other organizations' data
   └─> Full ERP functionality for their org
```

### Data Isolation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Super Admin View            │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐ │
│  │ Org A        │  │ Org B        │ │
│  │ - Users: 5   │  │ - Users: 3   │ │
│  │ - Sales: 120 │  │ - Sales: 85  │ │
│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Org A View    │    │   Org B View    │
│  ┌───────────┐  │    │  ┌───────────┐  │
│  │ Only Org A│  │    │  │ Only Org B│  │
│  │ Data      │  │    │  │ Data      │  │
│  └───────────┘  │    │  └───────────┘  │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```
